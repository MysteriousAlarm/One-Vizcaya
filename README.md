# 🏛️ One Vizcaya: Community Reporting & Emergency Response System

***Isang Boses. Isang Vizcaya.***

> `One Vizcaya` is a cross-platform civic-reporting and emergency-response ecosystem for the Province of Nueva Vizcaya, built as a **Turborepo monorepo** — a **Flutter** citizen app, a **React + TypeScript** LGU admin console, and a **Firebase Cloud Functions** backend. It bridges the gap between the ~530,106 residents of Nueva Vizcaya and their Local Government Units (LGU), routing field data and emergencies from the Barangay level all the way to the Provincial Capitol in real time.

> **Project status:** Feature-rich working prototype, developed by a Nueva Vizcaya State University team. Offered to the Provincial Government as a **managed service**, ready for a supervised pilot in a single municipality prior to wider rollout. See the [Development Roadmap](#-development-roadmap), [Future Features](#-future-features), [Cost & Sustainability Plan](#-cost--sustainability-plan), and [Service Model](#-service-model-ownership--continuity).

## 📌 Project Overview
One Vizcaya provides a centralized, multi-tenant hub where residents can report localized emergencies and infrastructure issues — from public-health concerns to agricultural asset damage — and trigger **live-location SOS beacons** in a crisis. Using **real-time Firestore streams**, **GeoJSON administrative boundaries**, **offline queuing**, **biometric authentication**, and **live GPS dispatch**, the platform reduces bureaucratic delay, speeds emergency response, and gives provincial executives a secure, data-driven view of the province.

Importantly, the platform is built to **feed and support existing LGU offices, hotlines, and disaster-management workflows — not to replace them.** It is a structured, mapped, trackable intake layer in front of the systems the province already operates.

## 🌟 Core Aims
* **Civilian Empowerment:** Lower the technical barrier for rural communities to report problems and call for help via an offline-first, media-optimized app — in English, Tagalog, and Ilocano.
* **Faster Emergency Response:** When a resident presses SOS, responders receive the person's **live location** instantly — so an ambulance can reach the exact spot even if the caller can't speak.
* **Operational Integrity:** Reduce fraudulent reporting with **GPS-stamped camera evidence**, a **camera-vs-gallery trust signal**, and **human review of every report and SOS** before any dispatch.
* **Administrative Load-Balancing:** Hierarchical, tenant-isolated roles so barangay/municipal offices handle local issues while the Capitol monitors high-impact escalations.
* **Provincial Resource Strategy:** Give the Governor and Provincial Administrator empirical data on where problems concentrate and how efficiently each town resolves them.

## 🏛️ Governance & Authority Architecture (Government Hierarchy)

One Vizcaya is deliberately modelled on the **real chain of governance** under the Local Government Code — **Barangay → City/Municipality → Province → Region II** — so authority, accountability, and data ownership line up one-to-one with how the Provincial Government of Nueva Vizcaya operates. Full treatment in **[`docs/Architecture-Governance-Design.md`](docs/Architecture-Governance-Design.md)** and **[`docs/Governance-Architecture.md`](docs/Governance-Architecture.md)**.

### The four-tier hierarchy

| Tier | Government Level | Represented In System As |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | Barangay (lowest LGU unit) | Barangay workspace — Punong Barangay / delegate & tanod |
| **Tier 2** | City / Municipality | Municipal dashboard — MLGU offices (MDRRMO, Engineering, RHU…) |
| **Tier 3** | Province | Provincial Command Hub — PA, PDRRMO, PPDO, PITD |
| **Tier 4** *(external)* | National / Regional agencies | Referral targets — DPWH Region II, DILG, NDRRMC… |

### The four-layer model (every tier must satisfy all four)

| Layer | The Question It Answers | How One Vizcaya guarantees it |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Governance** | *Who is in charge here?* | Custom-claim roles with bounded, non-overlapping scope |
| **Accountability** | *Who answers for this?* | One accountable owner per report; ownership transfers only via explicit, audited handoffs |
| **Data** | *What do we hold, and who owns it?* | Province is RA 10173 data **controller**; each LGU stewards its slice; the dev team is **processor, never owner** |
| **Technical** | *How does the system guarantee it?* | Enforced in **`firestore.rules` / `storage.rules` / Cloud Functions at the database layer — not just the UI** |

### Authority & accountability principles

- **Bounded authority.** A **Barangay admin** sees and acts **only within their own barangay** (scoped by `municipality` **and** `barangay` in the rules); a **Municipal admin** is confined to **their own town** (they cannot open another municipality's dashboard); **Provincial/Super** act province-wide. A higher tier can *view* what is below it but **cannot silently override** a lower tier's ownership.
- **Single accountable owner.** Every report has exactly **one** owner at any moment. Escalation up a tier happens **only when an admin formally routes it, never automatically.**
- **Append-only audit trail.** Every ownership/status transfer and privileged action (role approval, escalation approval, residency certification, SOS-abuse marking, account-deletion archival) writes an immutable `audit_logs` entry via Cloud Functions.

> These boundaries are enforced where they cannot be bypassed: the database security rules. The dashboards and app merely reflect them. See [`firestore.rules`](firestore.rules) — its header maps each design rule to the exact enforcing clause.

---

## 🔑 Roles & Access Control

Five roles, mapped to the government hierarchy. The legacy `admin` role has been **retired** and existing accounts migrated to `provincial_admin`.

| Role | Scope | Can do |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `citizen` | Own data | Report, SOS, view own reports, manage privacy |
| `barangay_admin` | Own barangay | Reports **routed to their barangay**, certify residents, Live Emergencies in their barangay |
| `municipal_admin` | Own municipality | Town reports, announcements, analytics, responders, escalate/route, dispatch emergencies |
| `provincial_admin` | Province-wide | All of the above across every town + user management |
| `super_admin` | Everything | Unrestricted; **approves role nominations**; direct role assignment |

**Nominate → Approve workflow.** No admin below super-admin can grant a role directly. A municipal/provincial admin **nominates** a user (a `roleRequests` document); a **super admin approves**, and a Cloud Function (`onRoleRequestDecision`) applies the role server-side (Auth custom claim + profile) and audits it. Role scope (municipality + barangay) is captured at nomination.

**Role-tinted dashboards.** Each tier's dashboard is coloured by rank for at-a-glance clarity — Barangay green, Municipal blue, Provincial purple, Super Admin red.

---

## 🧩 Feature Catalogue

### Citizen Mobile App
- **Problem reporting** with category, priority, GPS, barangay, and **GPS-stamped photo evidence** (see below).
- **Emergency SOS with live location** (see [SOS section](#-emergency-sos--live-location)).
- **Offline report queue** — reports drafted offline are queued locally and auto-submitted on reconnect, with a live queue-count banner; **SMS fallback** for zero-data areas.
- **Residency verification** — certify as a Nueva Vizcaya resident (Barangay Certificate / gov ID) so you can report from anywhere; GPS-verified or admin-certified.
- **Announcements** — municipal + province-wide, with **bookmarks**, sort (newest/oldest), and filter by posting agency.
- **Weather** — current conditions + forecast per municipality, backed by a scheduled provincial **rainfall watch** that raises advisories.
- **Emergency contacts** — national, provincial, and municipal hotlines (PNP, BFP, MDRRMO/PDRRMO, hospitals) plus mental-health/crisis, women & child protection, health, cybercrime, and citizen-service lines. Placeholder numbers are clearly marked and non-dialable.
- **Report tracker** — animated status (Reported → Acknowledged → Ongoing → Solved) with real-time push updates and citizen feedback/rating.
- **Municipality identity** — adaptive theming + a home-seal info sheet (title, founding, barangays, trivia; curated offline + live Wikipedia summary).
- **Privacy & rights (RA 10173)** — first-launch consent, full in-app privacy policy, **Download My Data** (JSON/PDF), and in-app **data-subject requests** (access/correction/erasure/objection/portability/complaint).
- **Quality of life** — biometric login, dark mode, deep links (`onevizcaya://status?reportId=…`), FCM tap-routing, full-screen photo viewer, QR scan/share, haptics, in-app review prompt, trilingual UI.

### LGU Admin Console (Web)
- **Public landing page** for residents (overview + direct APK download).
- **Overview** dashboard, **Live Reports** (triage, status, notes, canned responses, PDF export), **Incident Map**, **Analytics** (Recharts), **Responders** directory, **Residency** approval queue, **Admin Users** (nominate/approve/filter/sort), **Announcements**, **Broadcast Alert**, **Audit Log**, and **Live Emergencies**.
- **Role-scoped** everything: a municipal admin only sees their town; a barangay admin only their barangay; provincial/super see the province with a town switcher.
- **4-level report routing** (Barangay/Municipal/Provincial/Region II) with on-screen criteria.
- **Announcement composer** with agency/source attribution and link import (auto-fills title + body from a source page's Open Graph/meta tags).

---

## 🚨 Emergency SOS & Live Location

Inspired by real gaps in 911-style dispatch (operators unable to pin a caller's location), One Vizcaya makes an emergency **self-locating**:

- **One-tap SOS** creates a live emergency **beacon** with the caller's exact GPS **before/while** the call connects — so responders have the location even if the caller can't speak.
- **Live tracking with graceful fallback** — while active, the phone streams its position into the beacon. GPS works with no signal and Firestore's offline queue coalesces updates, so a dropped connection holds the last-known position and **resumes live tracking automatically** when the connection is stable.
- **Real-time responder dispatch** — a **Live Emergencies** view (mobile banner + web page with map pins) shows open beacons **scoped to the operator's tier**, with one-tap **Navigate** (Google Maps to the exact coords), **Call**, **Dispatch**, and **Resolve**.
- **Instant push** — `onSosAlertCreated` sends a high-priority FCM to the in-scope responders (provincial/super province-wide, the town's municipal admin, the barangay's barangay admin) the moment a beacon fires.
- **Anti-abuse without false negatives** — every SOS is **operator-verified** (call/message → "Verify") before dispatch; repeat/rapid SOS are **soft-flagged** (sorted last, marked "verify first") but **never dropped**; marking an SOS as abuse increments a per-user tally that auto-flags repeat offenders. Citizens can't self-verify or clear a flag (rule-enforced).

---

## 📸 Photo Evidence & GPS Stamping

To make photo evidence trustworthy and instantly actionable:

- **GPS Map Camera-style stamp** — a photo taken with the in-app **camera** is stamped, baked into the pixels, with the **place** (barangay, municipality, Nueva Vizcaya), **latitude/longitude**, **date/time**, and a **QR code** that opens the exact spot in Google Maps. Rendered on a canvas with `qr_flutter`; survives the JPEG re-compress on upload, so it stays visible and tamper-evident wherever the image is viewed.
- **Camera-vs-gallery trust badge** — the report records `photoSource`, and admins see a green **"Live camera · GPS-stamped"** vs amber **"From gallery · unverified"** badge, so an operator can trust the evidence at a glance.
- **Data minimization** — raw EXIF (hidden GPS/serial/timestamp) is **stripped** before upload; the verified GPS/time we keep is stored explicitly on the report document.

---

## 🏛️ Multi-Tiered Triage & Routing

**No report is ever auto-dispatched — a human reviews every submission.** Beyond upward escalation, admins can **route a report to the correct administrative tier** in one tap, with on-screen criteria for each tier:

| Tier | When it applies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Barangay** | Very local, low-risk matters a barangay can resolve (stray animals, uncollected garbage, clogged local canals, minor streetlight/signage issues). |
| **Municipal** | Town-wide services/infrastructure beyond a single barangay (municipal roads, local flooding/drainage, public health & safety). |
| **Provincial** | High-impact or cross-municipal incidents needing provincial resources (major disasters, provincial roads/bridges, large-scale hazards). |
| **Region II** | National/regional mandate or assets (national highways/bridges via DPWH Region II, region-wide calamities). |

Escalation to Provincial/Region II is an **auditable handoff** — it stamps who approved it and when, and only the owning municipality's admin can approve it.

---

## 🛰️ Geospatial Architecture

- **Barangay & municipal boundaries** — the incident map renders municipality choropleth polygons and, on drill-down, **barangay boundary polygons** for all 15 municipalities (266 barangays, from the faeldon 2023 PSGC GeoJSON), with a barangay filter.
- **Report density heat** — a green→yellow→red intensity overlay + per-municipality zone bubbles highlight hotspots; a time-range switch re-aggregates by recency.
- **Live positions** — report pins (exact GPS where available) and responder pins, plus SOS beacons with pulsing markers.
- **Scope-aware** — the map follows the dashboard's scope: a municipal/scoped view centres and zooms on that town instead of the whole province.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Handling

Designed **in accordance with Republic Act No. 10173 (Data Privacy Act of 2012)**. Upon adoption, the LGU is the data controller; the system supports that responsibility:

* **Data minimization** — collects only what a report/SOS requires; raw EXIF stripped from photos.
* **Informed consent** — first-launch consent screen with auditable timestamps; full in-app privacy policy.
* **Data-subject rights** — in-app **Download My Data** (JSON/PDF) and access/correction/erasure/objection/portability/complaint requests logged for the DPO.
* **Defined retention** — reports auto-archived after 12 months and deleted (with photos) after 24 months by scheduled jobs.
* **Access control** — Firestore rules ensure citizens see only their own data and admins only their jurisdiction; **location on an SOS is readable only by the owner and in-scope responders**.
* **Compliance roadmap** — NPC registration and DPO designation completed jointly with the adopting LGU before public launch.

---

## 🎨 UI, Theming & Identity
Each municipality has a **definitive title** and a coordinated color scheme; the interface re-themes to the active jurisdiction. Text/icon contrast is computed automatically so any theme stays legible in light and dark mode.

| Municipality | Definitive Title | Primary (App Bar) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alfonso Castañeda** | The Hydroelectric Powerhouse | `#8B0000` Deep Red |
| **Ambaguio** | The Gateway to Mount Pulag | `#008080` Teal |
| **Aritao** | The Onion Capital | `#E27D60` Onion Coral |
| **Bagabag** | The Pineapple Haven | `#F4A460` Goldenrod |
| **Bambang** | The Agricultural Hub | `#800000` Maroon |
| **Bayombong** | The Educational & Institutional Capital | `#006400` Dark Green |
| **Diadi** | The Eco-Tourism Sanctuary | `#2E8B57` Sea Green |
| **Dupax del Norte** | The Agro-Forestry Frontier | `#8B4513` Saddle Brown |
| **Dupax del Sur** | The Heritage Capital | `#A52A2A` Burgundy |
| **Kasibu** | The Citrus Capital of the Philippines | `#FF8C00` Citrus Orange |
| **Kayapa** | The Summer Capital of Nueva Vizcaya | `#4682B4` Steel Blue |
| **Quezon** | The Mineral Outpost | `#4169E1` Royal Blue |
| **Santa Fe** | The Gateway to Cagayan Valley | `#556B2F` Dark Olive |
| **Solano** | The Premier Commercial Core | `#0A369D` Deep Blue |
| **Villaverde** | The Trailblazer's Sanctuary | `#32CD32` Lime Green |

---

## 🌐 Multilingual Support

Native **trilingual** support — **English**, **Tagalog (Filipino)**, and **Ilocano** — across onboarding, report forms, settings, announcements, notifications, FAQ, and error messages. Language is switchable any time and persisted across sessions.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 22+** and **npm 10+** (web + functions)
- **Flutter (stable)** with the Android/iOS toolchains (mobile)
- **Firebase CLI** (`npm i -g firebase-tools`) with access to the Firebase project
- Local secret files (git-ignored, obtained from the team): `apps/mobile/lib/firebase_options.dart`, `apps/mobile/android/app/google-services.json`, and any `secrets.dart` / `key.properties`. A `restore-secrets.bat` helper is provided for Windows.

### Web admin console (`apps/web`)
```bash
npm install                 # from repo root (installs web + functions workspaces)
npm run dev                 # Turborepo → Vite dev server for apps/web
# or, directly:
cd apps/web && npm run dev
```
Build: `npm run build:web` (root) or `npm run build` in `apps/web` (`tsc -b && vite build`).

### Mobile app (`apps/mobile`)
```bash
cd apps/mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run                 # on a connected device/emulator
flutter build apk --release # release APK
```

### Cloud Functions (`apps/functions`)
```bash
cd apps/functions
npm install
firebase deploy --only functions   # from the repo root
```

> **Monorepo command rule:** run `flutter` from `apps/mobile`, `npm` (web) from `apps/web`, and `firebase` from the **repo root**.

---

## 📦 Deployment

| Target | Command (from repo root) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Firestore rules + indexes | `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes` |
| Cloud Functions | `firebase deploy --only functions` |
| Cloud Storage rules | `firebase deploy --only storage` |
| Web console (build + hosting) | `npm run build:web && firebase deploy --only hosting` |
| Mobile | `cd apps/mobile && flutter build apk --release` (then distribute / Play) |

Some administrative one-shots run as callable functions by a super admin (e.g. `seedResponders`, `migrateLegacyAdmins`). Full build/deploy/phone-auth steps — including the Google Play Internal Testing route that fixes real-number login — are in [`docs/Computer-Shop-Runbook.md`](docs/Computer-Shop-Runbook.md).

## 🔮 Future Features

Planned enhancements beyond the current build:

### Emergency & response
- **Live SOS tracking on a moving map** — continuous "blue-dot" tracking of a moving person for responders (on top of the current one-shot + live updates).
- **Two-way SOS chat** — operator ↔ citizen text thread on an active beacon for callers who can type but not speak.
- **Reverse-geocoded street address** on the photo stamp and SOS card (Google Geocoding API) and an optional **static-map thumbnail** on the stamp.
- **Responder mobile app / role** — field responders receive assignments and update status from their own device; ETA + arrival confirmation.
- **DPWH / PDRRMO system integration** — a direct pipeline into provincial emergency systems (see [`docs/PDRRMO-Integration-Brief.md`](docs/PDRRMO-Integration-Brief.md)).

### Trust, security & access
- **Admin 2FA (TOTP)** — authenticator second factor for admin accounts via Firebase Identity Platform.
- **App Check enforcement hardening** + rate-limiting/WAF posture against SOS/report flooding at the infrastructure layer.
- **Accessibility fallback** — SMS / hotline / proxy-reporting path for residents without smartphones.
- **Duplicate-report clustering** — auto-group nearby reports of the same incident to cut operator load.

### Data & intelligence
- **Predictive hotspot analytics** — flood/landslide risk overlays combining rainfall watch + historical reports.
- **Cross-municipal executive dashboard** — comparative resolution-time and SLA scorecards for the Governor's office.
- **Public transparency portal** — an opt-in, anonymized public map of resolved community issues.
- **In-app announcement scheduling & templates** for LGU communications teams.

### Platform
- **Push-to-web parity** for admins (browser notifications for new SOS/critical reports).
- **Localization expansion** — additional dialects and full accessibility (screen-reader) passes.
- **Automated backups & data-export scheduling** for the LGU's records.

One Vizcaya is engineered to be **extremely low-cost to operate**, with no vendor lock-in. Figures use **Firebase Blaze (pay-as-you-go) standard pricing** and are intentionally **conservative**.

> **Bottom line:** A single-municipality pilot runs at effectively **₱0/month**. A province-wide rollout is estimated well under **₱5,000/month** — less than a single staff salary line, serving all 15 municipalities.

### How cost is driven
Firebase cost is driven by **activity, not population** — reads, writes, and stored photos, not registered residents. Cost controls already in the design: offline persistence & local drafting, client-side image compression, user-scoped sub-collections, dashboard pagination, and a 12-month auto-archive of resolved reports.

### Summary

| Scale | Active reporters/mo | Reports/mo | Estimated monthly cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 Municipality (Pilot)** | ~900 | ~1,800 | **≈ ₱0** (within free quotas) |
| **3 Municipalities** | ~2,300 | ~4,600 | **≈ ₱50–₱150** |
| **Province-wide (normal)** | ~5,300 | ~10,600 | **≈ ₱500** |
| **Province-wide (stress + buffer)** | ~15,900 | ~31,800 | **≈ ₱3,000–₱4,500** |

### Honest cost risks
1. **Disaster spikes** — reads/uploads (and SOS) surge for a few days during a major typhoon; the buffer covers this and it is temporary.
2. **SMS authentication** — phone-OTP costs ~$0.01–$0.06 per SMS; reserve SMS for auth/accessibility only.
3. **Unoptimized listeners** — careless real-time queries amplify reads; pagination + scoped streams guard against this.
4. **Dropping the archive policy** — storage grows unbounded without the 12-month auto-archive; it must be kept.

### Two separate line items
| Cost component | What it is | Billing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Cloud infrastructure** | Firebase/Google Cloud usage | Passed through transparently, no markup |
| **B. Professional service** | Hosting, maintenance, security updates, features, training, support | Defined service fee under the engagement agreement |

> Infrastructure (A) is genuinely low; the primary value the Province pays for is the **service (B)** — a professional team keeping the platform secure, updated, supported, and improving. Full detail (pricing tables, scenarios A–C) is available on request. *Estimates are re-validated against live Firebase pricing before any procurement decision.*

## 🤝 Service Model, Ownership & Continuity

One Vizcaya is offered as a **managed service**, not a one-time code dump. The team builds, hosts, maintains, and improves the platform under a service agreement, while the LGU retains full control of its data.

### Who owns what
* **Software & IP:** retained by the development team; the LGU receives a **non-exclusive license to use** the platform for the province.
* **Government data:** owned entirely by the LGU — all citizen reports, media, and records belong to the Provincial Government and are exportable at any time.

### Continuity (not dependency)
* **Source-code escrow / continuity clause** — a copy of the full source + deployment docs is held in escrow (or with the LGU legal office), released to the LGU if the team ever ceases to operate.
* **Team, not a solo dependency**; **standard, non-proprietary stack** (Flutter + Firebase + React); **full documentation & one-click data export**.

### What the agreement covers
Hosting setup, ongoing maintenance & security updates, feature development, staff training & support, and transparently-billed cloud infrastructure.

> *Engagement terms (period, scope, fees) are defined jointly with the Provincial Government under applicable government procurement rules.*
